# **Chess Game - Project**

This **Chess Game** project was made during the course **Clean Code**. In this project I tried my best to show what I have learnt during the course - **source control**, proper naming of **methods**, **variables**, **classes**, making **unit test** **documentation** etc. 

Special thanks to our teacher **Philip Yankov** for the great teaching and motivation during the course.
